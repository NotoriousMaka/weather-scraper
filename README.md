## Supported Locations

The scraper supports cities from around the world. Use the country and city names as they appear in TimeAndDate.com URLs:

### Country Examples:
- `uk` - United Kingdom
- `usa` - United States
- `canada` - Canada
- `australia` - Australia
- `germany` - Germany
- `france` - France
- `japan` - Japan
- `italy` - Italy

### City Name Format:
- Use lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Examples: `new-york`, `los-angeles`, `san-francisco`

### Finding Correct Names:
1. Visit timeanddate.com/weather
2. Search for your city
3. Note the country and city format in the URL

## Configuration

### Browser Settings

Current configuration:
- **Headless mode**: Disabled (for debugging)
- **Viewport**: 1280x800 pixels
- **Timeout**: 20 seconds for page elements

### Enable Headless Mode

For production use, modify the `setBrowser()` function:

```javascript
const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
```

### Adjust Timeout

To change the timeout for element waiting:

```javascript
await page.waitForSelector("#wt-ext", { timeout: 30000 }); // 30 seconds
```

## Error Handling

The scraper includes robust error handling for:

- **Invalid country/city combinations**
- **Network connectivity issues**
- **Page loading timeouts**
- **Missing weather data**
- **Browser launch failures**

### Common Error Scenarios:

1. **City not found**: Returns empty array or null
2. **Network timeout**: Logs "Scraping failed" with error details
3. **Invalid URL format**: Page fails to load weather data

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The scraper consists of three main functions:

1. **`setBrowser()`** - Initializes Playwright browser
2. **`navigateAndScrape()`** - Handles navigation and data extraction  
3. **`main()`** - Orchestrates the process and error handling

### Data Extraction Strategy

The scraper targets the extended weather table (`#wt-ext`) and extracts data from:
- Table rows (`tbody tr`)
- Cell data (`th, td` elements)
- Specific column mappings for each weather metric

### Performance Optimization

- Waits for DOM content loaded (faster than full page load)
- Uses efficient CSS selectors
- Extracts all data in a single page evaluation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"City not found" errors**
   - Verify country and city spelling
   - Check TimeAndDate.com for exact URL format
   - Use lowercase and hyphens for city names

2. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase timeout value
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify TimeAndDate.com accessibility

3. **Empty results**
   - Confirm the city has weather data on TimeAndDate.com
   - Check for recent website structure changes

4. **Browser launch issues**
   - Run: `npx playwright install chromium`
   - Ensure sufficient system resources

### Debug Mode

The scraper runs with visible browser by default. Watch the automation to identify:
- Incorrect URL construction
- Page loading issues
- Missing weather table elements

### Testing Locations

Test with known working combinations:
```bash
node weather-play.js uk london
node weather-play.js usa new-york
node weather-play.js australia sydney
```

## Rate Limiting & Ethics

- Built-in delays through Playwright
- Respectful scraping practices
- Single request per execution
